# Warcraft-rs

**warcraft-rs** is an open-source Rust toolkit and library ecosystem for working with **World of Warcraft** file formats, covering game versions from **Vanilla (1.x)** through **Mists of Pandaria (5.x)**. It is built for modders, emulation developers, and data enthusiasts who need fast, safe, and zero-copy parsing and manipulation of WoW data files.

## Use Cases

- Inspecting, extracting, and modifying **MPQ archives**  
- Reading and analyzing **DBC**, **ADT**, and **WMO** files  
- Developing modding and emulation tools  
- Integrating WoW data parsing safely and efficiently into Rust projects

## Features

- Modular command-line interface and Rust libraries  
- Efficient zero-allocation parsing and safe Rust abstractions  
- Feature flags to include only needed components for lightweight builds  
- Cross-platform support  
- Comprehensive parsing of core WoW file formats
